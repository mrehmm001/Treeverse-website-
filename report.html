           <div class="section-header">Introduction</div>
            <div class="section-info">My website is going to be made for a community of people who plant trees, this is to raise awareness about climate change and deforestation. As you may be aware, deforestation is happening at an alarming rate, and considering they produce the air we breathe, they also act as a deterrent against natural disasters such as floods and landslides as tree’s roots are used to suck in gallons of water. Trees are also helpful for combating against man-made disaster such as drouts and smog as trees take in Carbon Dioxide and other greenhouse gasses and purifies the air. These are the reasons why many people planting trees and why many organisations like Team Trees has appeared, therefore I made a website about planting trees to raise awareness.</div>
            
        </div>
        <div class="report-container3">
           <div class="section-header">Background</div>
            <div class="section-info">The audience my website will cater to will be mostly aged between 15-40, However, that’s not to say much younger or older people can’t be aware of today’s problems, they can, but people amongst these age range I mentioned tend be on social media, and news about climate change usually trends more on it compared to let’s say Cable television. My stakeholders will be university students of Goldsmiths, their age range will be like what I stated (15-40).</div>
            <div class="section-info">Websites about planting trees is no original idea, my inspirations came from #TeamTrees as it was one the company that was able to bring awareness to a large audience, mostly from shout outs from internet celebrities such as Mr Beast and Elon Musk, they achieved their goal to raise 20 million dollars before the beginning of 2020. My other inspirations came from, as previously mentioned Mr-Beast as he was the one who brought awareness to me about the growing problems of today’s world. Elon Musk has also inspired me as he was one of the biggest contributors to TeamTrees as he donated one million dollars to #TeamTrees, but also the fact that he owns a company, Tesla which makes environmentally friendly vehicles.</div>
            
        </div>
        <div class="report-container4">
           <div class="section-header">Planning</div>
            <div class="section-info">I’ve researched many types of structures, but the structure the I chose a one-column website layout as it is a really simple yet effective layout, also the fact most websites tend to follow this layout. Information would be neatly organised into columns making them easy to access and understand. E.g I’ve researched a website which inspired me to use this structure, this website has nothing to do with trees, but I was really inspired by it’s simplistic yet effective layout. The website follows a single column layout which is fairly common amongst many websites. I’ve also noticed some interactivity of the navbar that would’ve used JavaScript to achieve this. This interactivity only activates when the navbar is scrolled away from the topped, changing the logo to an icon and making the navbar thinner. Another thing I noticed about this website is colour contrast and the font style. The white font colour on the navbar and headings contrasts really well with the black background, same can be said about the black font colour on white background. The thick font choice also helps making the writing easier to be read.</div>
            <div class="section-info">I have also made a huge effort in terms of making my website accessible to anybody. For instance, I used normal, and slightly larger sizes of font for the website with the help of an appropriate to make reading easier. I also added alt tags to all images so that if any images fail to load, at least the client will know what that image was about, this can also help those who are colour blind, tunnel vision or poor eye site, they would struggle to figure out what the image looks like. </div>
            <div class="section-info">I used tools such as WCAG to get a proper analysis of my website. The results were decent as I have gained total of 20 passes compared to 8 violations, though those violations. </div>
            <div class="section-info">I also made the website usable nearly on all platforms as I made the website responsive for mobile view making the website accessible for nearly anybody who owns a smartphone.</div>
            <div class="section-info">The consistent colour pallet ive used in the website are natural colours that are meant to represent nature. I used colours that contrast from the background, making them easier to read, allowing users who may suffer from slight colour blindness to read without any issues.</div>
            <div class="section-info">I also made navigation of the website simple and easy to use. For instance, the Nav-bar always sticks to the top of the website allowing the user to use it on any point of the web page. Furthermore, I’ve added buttons on some pages that scrolls you to the specific spot, this is useful as it can help users show them information they want through the request of a button.</div>
            
        </div>
        <div class="report-container5">
           <div class="section-header">Implementation</div>
            <div class="section-info">Before and during the production of the website, I’ve researched ways that were essential for my website. One really useful feature I researched was the flexbox which I learnt by my self from w3schools.com. This feature is what helps with the responsiveness of my website, for instance, I used flex warp that forces flex-items on the website to go onto a new line if the screen width shrinks to a certain point.</div>
            <div class="section-info">Another really useful feature I learnt was @media query which, like flex-wrap, also helped with the responsiveness, this feature works like an if statement. For instance I used “ @media screen and (max-width:1260px)” which was what I used to change the navbar into to a responsive navbar for mobile view, I learnt this feature on youtube tutorials.</div>
            <div class="section-info">I also learnt transitions for my website, this feature is what enabled the smooth movements effects throughout the whole website. I used transition to achieve the hover effect of the nav bar links, e.g every time you dark the mouse over to one of the five links, a line under the link smoothly appears. I learnt this feature from w3school.com</div>
            <div class="section-info">I used recourse that helped me throughout the making of my website. For instance, I used jQuery to program some of the functions I needed to for my website, e.g the Parralax and the responsive Navbar effects were made possible due to jQuery. jQuery made scripting significantly more easier compared to normal JavaScript as many functions, methods have been simplified, e.g “document.getElementById(‘#container’);” has been simplified to “$(‘#container’);! Using jQuery has saved me so much. </div>
            <div class="section-info">Another resource I used that helped me throughout the making of my website was using Pexels.com, this website hosts royalty free, copyright free images and videos, this was the website where I have used images for my website. The images on the site are high quality, and free for use! So, this website was my go to when ever I needed images. </div>
            <div class="section-info">P5JS was also used. I needed to make a simulated live feed for how many trees has been planted. First I tried using jQuery, however I received issues where the constant incrementing of numbers for the counter caused performance issues for my website, so I tried P5JS where I used its draw function for this purpose as it is highly optimised. </div>
            <div class="section-info">Youtube was also a website I used constantly as the tutorials on there were very helpful for me. Dev Ed, a website developer owns a channel where he has 30-minute crash courses on nearly anything, e.g I watched his crash course on how to use FlexBox for my website, i’ve ended up learning a lot from his videos.</div>
            
        </div>
        <div class="report-container6">
            <div class="section-header">Evaluation</div>
            <div class="section-info">One of the first things that went well in my website was the use of the Parallax effect I made using jQuery. For example, the parallax effect is when the background image is moved along your scroll but at different speeds, my parallax effect was able to replicate that effect successfully. To top it off, I also made an effect whereas you scroll away from the parallax background, the background image darkens, which created an effect as if the parallax background was being tucked under the section div below it.</div>
            <div class="section-info">Another thing that turned out well in my website was the responsiveness to screen sizes. For instance, everything inside the website would shift relative to the screen width, so if you shrunk the width below 900px, the navbar will turn into a mobile navbar where you have to toggle the icon to access the navbar. So this means, the website can be useable for someone with a mobile phone with a screen width no smaller than 400px.</div>
            <div class="section-info">The use of colours on my website was also something that turned out well in my opinion, For instance, I used natural colours which reflected the theme of the website, which was about nature and trees. I also made sure to use contrasting colours for fonts so that it stuck out well against the background images, e.g I used colour white with 2px black text shadow around it, this helped the text jump out the background even better, making it much easier to read.</div>
            <div class="section-info">However, there could have been improvements to my website. For instance, had there been more time, I could’ve added more effects to my website, for instance, I could’ve added a feature where if you pressed a button, the information could’ve appeared out using an animation transition effect, or I could’ve had a effect where I could’ve enhanced the parallax effect by breaking up the image background into layers, and as you scroll, the layers follow the screen at different pace, creating a 3D effect.</div>
            <div class="section-info">I could’ve added a few more pages for the buttons that do not work, e.g In the “where we plant” section, I could’ve added separate pages that contained information about tree planting in Africa, America, Europe and Asia. Also I could’ve made the live feed counter save the numbers to a database so that every time you refresh the page, the numbers do not reset.</div>
            <div class="section-info">I could’ve have used open source plugins for my website. For instance, I could’ve saved my time by downloading an open source Parallax plugin instead of writing a parallax script. However I was not much aware about these features during making the website, it only came to my knowledge near the deadline where I figured out plugins could have been used as my advantage as there are millions of plugins on the internet, all serving different purposes.</div>
